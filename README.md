Authors: Ryan Morlando and Dominic Rey
Project Selected: We are going to do project 3. We are going to use a small version of centOS 7(around 800mb) on 2 instances. One instance will be the front-end web-server. This will be done by downloading Apache HTTP to the web-server instance as the managing service. The other instance will be downloading MariaDb to act as our MySQL back-end server. The user will then use the web-server to access information out of the database.
